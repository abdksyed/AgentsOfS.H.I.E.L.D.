# Implement the Fixes as per the Plan.md

* **Step 1:** Read the [plan.md](mdc:review/plan.md) file, and understand all the associated code files and the issues in each of them.
* **Step 2:** For each issue, read the code file to get the entire context, from the detailed plan section check the proposed solutions and their pros and cons. Select the most simple, reliable and best solution.
* **Step 3:** Implement the solution for that code file.
* **Step 4:** If there are multiple issues in different part of the same file repeat step 2 and 3.
* **Step 5:** Mark the issues as completed in the [plan.md](mdc:review/plan.md) file.
* **Step 6:** After all the issues are marked as completed, do the same as step 2 and 3 but instead of implementing the solution, review the solution was correctly implemented. If not, make necessary changes.
* **Step 7:** Run `npm run build` and resolve if there are any issues in the build.
* **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT STOP UNTIL ALL THE STEPS ARE COMPLETED.
