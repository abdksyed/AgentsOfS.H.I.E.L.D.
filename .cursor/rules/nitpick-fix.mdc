# Implement the Fixes as per the Plan.md

* **Step 1:** Read the [nitpicks_plan.md](mdc:review/nitpicks_plan.md) file, and understand all the associated code files and the issues in each of them.
* **Step 2:** For each file, read the code file to get the entire context, from the plan section for that file check the proposed solutions for each of the issue.
* **Step 3:** Implement the solution for that code file. While implementing if the code block/part being changes is no longer necessary or required, REMOVE the code instead of just commenting it. NO NEED TO KEEP THE OLD CODE AS COMMENTS UNLESS THEY ARE REQUIRED IN OTHER PARTS OF CODE
* **Step 4:** If there are multiple issues in different part of the same file repeat step 2 and 3.
* **Step 5:** Mark the issues as completed in the [nitpicks_plan.md](mdc:review/nitpicks_plan.md) file.
* **Step 6:** After all the issues are marked as completed, do the same as step 2 and 3 but instead of implementing the solution, review the solution was correctly implemented. If not, make necessary changes.
* **Step 7:** Run `npm run build` and resolve if there are any issues in the build.
* **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT STOP UNTIL ALL THE STEPS ARE COMPLETED.
