1. **Step 1:** Fetch the review comments from PR #X
    Use `gh api` commands to get the PR review comments and save the recent comment in `review/code_review.json` file

2. **Step 2:** Extract path, line, and comment body into a readable format
    Use `jq` command to convert the JSON file to text file by extracting review comments and ignoring outdated/resolved comments.
    Example: `jq -r ".[] | select(.line != null) | \"File: \(.path)\nStart Line: \(.start_line // \"N/A\")\nEnd Line: \(.line)\nComment: \(.body)\n---\"" review/code_review.json > review/code_review.txt`
